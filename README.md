## Description
A project to generate on the user side per environemnt Kubernetes manifests that can be deployed with ArgoCD.

## Motivation
Manifests that are written in kustomize/helm/jsonnet might easily become hard to read and debug. The development lifecycle becomes longer when after each change you need to commit, wait for ArgoCD to pick it up and deploy it. Only after that you see the actual end manifest in ArcoCD UI.

With this tool you can quickly render jinja2/kustomize files, run yaml linter and continuer development.

## Benefits
- Easier to grasp end manifests
- Shared variables between applications

## Configuration
### config.yml
Expected file structure
```
config:
  source_dir: source
  output_dir: output
  tmp_dir: .tmp

envs:
  - dev
  - stage
  - prod

vars:
  var_1:
    var_2: value_2
  var_3: value_3
```

With such configuration file you can have kustomize overlays for `dev/stage/prod` and jinja2 variables like `{{ var_1.var_2 }} and {{ var_3 }}` in your source files.

## Caveats
### Currently supported directory structure
```
repo
  source
    app_1
      base
        yaml.yml(.j2)
        kustomization.yml(.j2)
      dev
        yaml.yml(.j2)
        kustomization.yml(.j2)
      stage
        yaml.yml(.j2)
        kustomization.yml(.j2)
      prod
        yaml.yml(.j2)
        kustomization.yml(.j2)
    app_2
      yaml.yml(.j2)
      kustomization.yml(.j2)
    app_3
      yaml.yml(.j2)
```

### kustomization.yml
Files referenced in the `resources` section shall be named after Kubernetes resource types with lower case letters as a single word. Example:

```
resources:
  - deployment.yml
  - serviceaccount.yml
```
